    <h1>It's time to build some projects</h1>
    <pre>You have completed a long journey of learning HTML & CSS in the past 3 courses. 
        Learning how to build User Intefaces and Solving various small challenges that helped you learn the fundamentals of Web Development.
        Now you have all the necessary tools, it's time to build out a few projects from scratch by yourself. 
        Don't worry if you feel scared or when hit a roadblock in developing the projects, it is a common feeling we all go through during
         our learning face, and never be afraid of making mistakes. 
        The best way to learn is through your mistakes, they teach us a lot about how it's done then we learn from a tutorial.
        The Projects that you'll be buidling are Guided in nature. Each project is broken down into steps to help you track progress 
        and build projects with real milestones in place.
        Each step in the project will consists of a set of Challenges (available in the challenges sidebar similar to how you solved the 
        challenges in exercise labs) and Instructions that would guide you on building your project.
        Got a doubt, a bug that you can't figure out on your own. You can use any of the four mediums to get help.

    After completing each project, you can submit your project to generate a code report. 
    Which would give you feedback on which parts of the code can be improved along with an 
    overall score for the code you wrote based on several factors. You can use this feedback 
    to make changes to your code and improve the overall code quality and your ability to build amazing projects.
